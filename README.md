# Unity - 3D Simple Character Controller

Here I prepared a simple player movement controller for Unity that you can use in 3D projects. I have specified below the specific headers of the player controller.

* The new Input System is used for the keyboard inputs of the player controller. There are multiple ways to use Input System. Here, event system were used.

* In addition, the built-in Character Controller component was used for the motion operations of the player controller.
